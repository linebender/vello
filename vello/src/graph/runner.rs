//! Running a render graph has three important steps:
//!
//! 1) Resolving the paintings to be rendered, and importantly their sizes.
//!    Note that this *might* involve splitting the tree, because of [`OutputSize::Inferred`]
//! 2) Creating a graph to find the order in which those are to be rendered.
//!    Note that this doesn't have to dictate the order that their commands
//!    are encoded, only the order in which they are submitted.
//! 3) Running that graph. This involves encoding all the commands, and submitting them
//!    in the order calculated in step 2.
