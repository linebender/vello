//! This crate contains the test harness for `vello_cpu`.
//! - The `util` module contains shared utility functions that are needed by different
//!   test methods.
//! - We do not use the default Rust test harness, but instead use this `mod.rs` file as the
//!   entry point to run all other tests. The reason we chose this design is that it makes it
//!   easier to define shared utility functions needed by different tests.
//! - If you want to add new tests, try to follow these guidelines:
//!   - If your test can be classified to a clear "topic" (e.g. clipping, blending, etc.), put
//!     it into the corresponding module, or create a new one in case it doesn't exist yet.
//!   - If it cannot be classified cleanly, for now you can just put it into `basic.rs` which
//!     currently holds a bunch of different kinds of tests.
//!   - Tests for bugs should go into `issues.rs`.
//!   - For test naming, try to put the "topic" of the test at the start of the name instead of
//!     the end. For example, if your test case is about blend modes, `blend_mode_hard_light` is
//!     better than `hard_light_blend_mode`. This makes it easier to inspect the reference
//!     snapshots by topic.
