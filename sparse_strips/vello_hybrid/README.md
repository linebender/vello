This crate implements a hybrid CPU/GPU renderer for Vello. It offloads fine rasterization and other GPU-suited tasks while keeping core path processing on the CPU, making it a balanced solution for a variety of hardware.

## Features
- Hybrid rendering approach with CPU-based tiling and GPU-accelerated fine rasterization
- Efficient path processing with sparse strip representation
- Designed for performance across different hardware capabilities

## Usage
This crate serves as an optimized hybrid rendering engine, leveraging both CPU and GPU where appropriate.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Vello Hybrid has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.86** and later.

Future versions of Vello Hybrid might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

As time has passed, some of Vello Hybrid's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
