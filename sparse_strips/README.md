# Vello Sparse Strips

We are developing a new implementation for Vello that aims to:
- Be compatible with a wider range of devices (should be able to run on GPUs without compute shader support, using only fragment and vertex shaders).
- Mitigate some performance cliffs.
- Handle a wider range of memory conditions (e.g., when less memory is available).

This folder is being used to develop this implementation and is **not yet suitable for production use**. Our plan is to move the packages in this folder to the top level of the repository once they are ready for use.

This implementation is based on the **sparse rendering approach** outlined by Raph Levien (@raphlinus) in  
[*Potato: a hybrid CPU/GPU 2D renderer design*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEqf7ehTzd89Djf_VpkL0B_Fb15e0w5fuv_UzyacAPU/edit).  
It leverages **efficient tiling, sorting, and sparse strip allocation** to optimize rendering for both CPU and hybrid CPU/GPU workloads.

## Overview

This directory contains the core crates for the Vello rendering. Each crate serves a distinct role in the architecture, allowing modular development and easier maintenance.

### Crates
- **`vello_api`** – Defines the public API types shared across implementations.
- **`vello_common`** – Provides shared data structures and utilities for rendering.
- **`vello_cpu`** – Implements a CPU-based renderer optimized for multithreading and SIMD.
- **`vello_hybrid`** – A hybrid CPU/GPU renderer, balancing workload between CPU and GPU.

## Development Status

This structure is **under active development** and subject to changes as the integration progresses. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Community

Discussion of Vello Hybrid development happens in the [Linebender Zulip](https://xi.zulipchat.com/), specifically the [#vello channel](https://xi.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/197075-vello).
