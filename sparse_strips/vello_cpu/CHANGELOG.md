# Changelog

The latest published vello_cpu release is [0.0.4](#004---2025-10-17) which was released on 2025-10-17.
You can find its changes [documented below](#004---2025-10-17).

## [Unreleased]

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.88.

### Added

- The `RenderContext` now has a `set_blend_mode` (and a corresponding `blend_mode` 
  getter method) that can be used to support non-isolated blending ([#1159][] by [@LaurenzV])
- The `RenderContext` now contains a `push_clip_path` and `pop_clip_path` method for performing non-isolated clipping ([#1203][] by [@LaurenzV])
- Support for image filter effects: ([#1286][] by [@grebmeg][])
  - New filter API methods on `RenderContext`:
    - `set_filter_effect()` - Set a filter to be applied to subsequent drawing operations
    - `push_filter_layer()` - Create a new layer with a filter effect
  - `FilterEffect` trait providing both u8 and f32 precision variants for rendering 
  across different backends.
  - Gaussian Blur filter with configurable standard deviation and edge modes (`None`, `Mirror`, `Wrap`, `Duplicate`).
    Uses an optimized decimated blur algorithm with automatic downsampling for performance.
  - Drop Shadow filter with customizable offset, blur radius, and shadow color.
  - Flood filter for solid color fills.
  - Added a `set_mask` method to make it possible to mask rendered
    paths without inducing layer isolation ([#1237][] by [@LaurenzV])



### Known Limitations

- Filter effects currently support only single-primitive filters; filter graphs with multiple 
  chained primitives are not yet supported.
- Multithreaded rendering is not supported for filter effects; filters are only applied in 
  single-threaded mode.
