    /// There are three reasons for having this method.
    /// 1) Divisions are slower than shifting + adding, and the compiler does not seem to replace
    ///    divisions by 255 with an equivalent (this was verified by benchmarking; doing / 255 was
    ///    significantly slower).
    /// 2) Integer divisions are usually not available in SIMD, so this provides a good baseline
    ///    implementation.
    /// 3) There are two options for performing the division: One is to perform the division
    ///    in a way that completely preserves the rounding semantics of a integer division by
    ///    255. This could be achieved using the implementation `(val + 1 + (val >> 8)) >> 8`.
    ///    The second approach (used here) has slightly different rounding behavior to a
    ///    normal division by 255, but is much faster (see <https://github.com/linebender/vello/issues/904>)
    ///    and therefore preferable for the high-performance pipeline.
    ///
    /// Four properties worth mentioning:
    /// - This actually calculates the ceiling of `val / 256`.
    /// - Within the allowed range for `val`, rounding errors do not appear for values divisible by 255, i.e. any call `div_255(val * 255)` will always yield `val`.
    /// - If there is a discrepancy, this division will always yield a value 1 higher than the original.
    /// - This holds for values of `val` up to and including `65279`. You should not call this function with higher values.
