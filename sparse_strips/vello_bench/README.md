# Setup

In order to run the integration benchmarks with custom SVGs, you need to add the SVGs you want to run into the `data` folder. For each SVG file in that folder, a corresponding integration test will be generated automatically.

If you don't add any SVGs, the benchmarking harness will only use the ghostscript tiger by default.
