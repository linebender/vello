//! This crate includes common geometry representations, tiling logic, and other fundamental components used by both [Vello CPU][vello_cpu] and Vello Hybrid.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This crate should not be used on its own, and you should instead use one of the renderers which use it.
//! At the moment, only [Vello CPU][vello_cpu] is published, and you probably want to use that.
//!
//! We also develop [Vello](https://crates.io/crates/vello), which makes use of the GPU for 2D rendering and has higher performance than Vello CPU.
//! Vello CPU is being developed as part of work to address shortcomings in Vello.
//! Vello does not use this crate.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `std` (enabled by default): Get floating point functions from the standard library
//!   (likely using your target's libc).
//! - `libm`: Use floating point implementations from [libm].
//! - `png` (enabled by default): Allow loading [`Pixmap`][crate::pixmap::Pixmap]s from PNG images.
//!   Also required for rendering glyphs with an embedded PNG.
//!   Implies `std`.
//! - `simd`: Allows requesting SIMD execution modes.
//!   Note that SIMD is not yet implemented.
//!
//! At least one of `std` and `libm` is required; `std` overrides `libm`.
//!
//! ## Contents
//!
//! - Shared data structures for paths, tiles, and strips
//! - Geometry processing utilities
//! - Common logic for rendering stages
//!
//! This crate acts as a foundation for `vello_cpu` and `vello_hybrid`, providing essential components to minimize duplication.
