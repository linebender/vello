This crate defines the public API types for the Vello rendering. It provides common interfaces and data structures used across different implementations, including CPU, GPU, and hybrid rendering backends.

## Features
- Shared API types for Vello's rendering pipeline.
- Interfaces for render contexts and rendering options.
- Designed for compatibility across CPU and GPU implementations.

## Usage
This crate is intended to be used by other Vello components and external consumers needing a stable API.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Vello API has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.85** and later.

Future versions of Vello API might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

As time has passed, some of Vello API's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
