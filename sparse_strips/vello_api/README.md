## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Vello API has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.88** and later.

Future versions of Vello API might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of Vello API's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
