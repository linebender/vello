//! This is a utility library to help integrate the [Vello] shader modules into any renderer
//! project. It provides the necessary metadata to construct the individual compute pipelines
//! on any GPU API while leaving the responsibility of all API interactions
//! (such as resource management and command encoding) up to the client.
//!
//! The shaders can be pre-compiled to any target shading language at build time based on
//! feature flags. Currently only WGSL and Metal Shading Language are supported.
//!
//! Your first choice should be to use the build time generated [`SHADERS`].
//!
//! Alternatively you could use runtime compiled shaders via the [`compile`] module
//! by enabling the `compile` feature. This option is useful for active development
//! as it enables you to do hot reloading of shaders.
