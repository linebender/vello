# Vello Encoding

This package contains types that represent data that [Vello] can render.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Vello Encoding has been verified to compile with Rust 1.75 and later.

Note that since then, one of Vello Encoding's dependencies might have released a new version with a higher requirement.
Thus if you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency, you should downgrade it via `cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1` (with a real name and version).

Future versions of Vello Encoding might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.
