# Enabling this feature applies a transformation that converts all storage bindings
# to have the `read_write` access mode. For WGSL shaders, this affects the bind group
# layout of all pipelines and changes the usage scope of storage buffers. For MSL shaders,
# this removes the `const` qualifier from entry-point parameters in the `device` address
# space. This allows bindings with mixed access modes to be backed by suballocations from
# the same the buffer object.
#
# This feature doesn't apply to the fine stage where all storage bindings are readonly and
# the same access mode restrictions do not apply.
#
# Enabling this feature may have a performance impact and is not recommended.
