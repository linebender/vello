# Enabling this feature applies a transformation that converts all storage bindings
# to have the `read_write` access mode. For WGSL shaders, this affects the bind group
# layout of all pipelines and changes the usage scope of storage buffers. For MSL shaders,
# this removes the `const` qualifier from entry-point parameters in the `device` address
# space.
#
# Enabling this feature may have a performance impact and is not recommended.
