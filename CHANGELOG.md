# Changelog

The latest published Vello release is [0.3.0](#030---2024-10-04) which was released on 2024-10-04.
You can find its changes [documented below](#030---2024-10-04).

## [Unreleased]

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.75.

### Fixed

- Offset in image rendering, and sampling outside correct atlas area ([#722][] by [@dfrg])

## [0.3.0][] - 2024-10-04

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.75.

### Highlights

- Support for most Emoji ([#615][], [#641][] by [@DJMcNab])
- [GPU Friendly Stroke Expansion][stroke-expansion], which documents key parts of how Vello works, was released (by [@raphlinus], [@armansito])
- Blurred rounded rectangles are now supported, which can be used for box shadows ([#665][] by [@msiglreith][])
- Vello is no longer considered experimental ðŸŽ‰ ([#691][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
  Note that Vello is still an alpha, but we believe that the direction has been proven.

### Added

- Access to the `Adapter` from the utils `DeviceHandle` ([#634][] by [@cfagot][])
- Support for compositing existing `wgpu::Texture`s into a Vello scene ([#636][], [#655][] by [@DJMcNab], [@TrueDoctor][])
- Utilities for constructing an `AaSupport` from a set of `AaConfig`s ([#654][] by [@simbleau][])
- An example which uses sdl2 ([#671][] by [@TheNachoBIT][])
- The underlying `Encoding` for a scene can now be modified, circumventing guardrails for advanced use-cases ([#701][] by [@timtom-dev][])

### Changed

- Breaking: Updated `wgpu` to 22.1.0 ([#635][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- Clipping more than four layers deep is now supported ([#657][] by [@DJMcNab])
- Significantly improved automated testing ([#610][], [#643][] by [@DJMcNab])
- Preliminary debug layers for Vello's internal development ([#416][] by [@armansito])
- Examples now use the [`run_app`][] API from Winit ([#626][], [#628][] by [@yutannihilation][])
- Labels on GPU objects are now prefixed with `vello.` ([#677][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- The async render implementations are deprecated and unstable; you should use the non-async versions as they enable greater throughput ([#706][] by [@DJMcNab])

### Fixed

- Example code in the repository README ([#627][] by [@kmoon2437][])
- A possible crash on iOS working around an invariant undocumented by Apple ([#639][] by [@DJMcNab][])
- Large number of clips now work ([#659][] by [@raphlinus])
- Empty clips now no longer cause artifacts ([#651][] by [@raphlinus])
- A potential panic in the presence of a weaker than default allocator ([#675][] by [@timtom-dev][])
- Watertightness breaks causing artifacts with some rounded rectangles ([#695][] by [@raphlinus])

### Removed

- Breaking: `Pipelines` API from `vello_shaders` ([#612][] by [@DJMcNab])
- The `wgpu_profiler` profiler feature is no longer stable ([#694][] by [@DJMcNab])
- Breaking: Moved the `Recording` abstraction into a `low_level` module, as almost all users should prefer the higher-level `Renderer` ([#711][] by [@DJMcNab])

## [0.2.1][] - 2024-07-16
