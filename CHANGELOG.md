# Changelog

The latest published Vello release is [0.6.0](#060---2025-10-03) which was released on 2025-10-03.
You can find its changes [documented below](#060---2025-10-03).

## [Unreleased]

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.86.

### Fixed

- Bitmap emoji displayed at an incorrect position when scaled. ([#1273][] by [@ArthurCose][])

## [0.6.0][] - 2025-10-03

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.86.

### Added

- `register_texture`, a helper for using `wgpu` textures in a Vello `Renderer`. ([#1161][] by [@DJMcNab][])
- `push_luminance_mask_layer`, content within which is used as a luminance mask. ([#1183][] by [@DJMcNab][]).  
   This is a breaking change to Vello Encoding.
- `push_clip_layer`, which replaces the previous `push_layer` using `Mix::Clip`, and has fewer footguns. ([#1192][] by [@DJMcNab][])  
  This is not a breaking change, as `Mix::Clip` is still supported (although it is deprecated).
- Support for BGRA format images (as input). ([#1173][] by [@sagudev][])

### Changed

- Breaking change: wgpu has been updated to wgpu 26. ([#1096][] by [@waywardmonkeys][])  
  This has been chosen to match the version used by Bevy 0.17.
  (Note that we do not guarantee that our latest release will always match Bevy's wgpu version.)
- Breaking change: Put `wgpu`'s default features behind a `wgpu_default` feature flag. ([#1229][] by [@StT191][])  
  If you're using Vello with default features enabled, then no change is needed.
- Breaking change: Updated Peniko to [v0.5.0](https://github.com/linebender/peniko/releases/tag/v0.5.0). ([#1224][] by [@DJMcNab][])  
  This brings several important changes which allow Vello to be used in more use cases:
  - Breaking change: Gradients must have their alpha interpolation space specified. For this, you should use `InterpolationAlphaSpace::Premultiplied`, unless you are implementing a specification which indicates otherwise.
    Currently, only `InterpolationAlphaSpace::Premultiplied` is supported.
  - Breaking change: `Gradient` kinds now have a corresponding struct. For example, `GradientKind::Linear {...}` is now `LinearGradientPosition {...}.into()`.
    This makes it possible to pass individual gradient kinds between functions.
  - `GradientKind::Sweep`'s defined semantics now match those which Vello previously implemented.
  - Breaking change: `Image` has been renamed to `ImageBrush`, consisting of an `ImageData` and an `ImageSampler`.
    The equivalent to the old `Image::new($data, $format, $width, $height)` is `ImageBrush::new(ImageData { data: $data, format: $format, width: $width, height: $height, alpha_type: ImageAlphaType::Alpha })`
    (or `ImageData { ... }.into()` if you don't need to set sampler parameters).
  - Breaking change: `vello::peniko::Font` is now called `vello::peniko::FontData`.
    This type is also now provided by [Linebender Resource Handle](https://crates.io/crates/linebender_resource_handle).
- We now treat Vello's shaders as trusted for memory safety purposes. ([#1093][] by [@sagudev][])  
  If you're using Vello in a security critical environment with user-controlled content, you should audit these shaders yourself, or open an issue to request that these bounds checks are re-enabled.

### Linebender Resource Handle

The `vello::peniko::Font` type used in Vello used to be provided by the Peniko crate, and this was used as vocabulary types for font resources between crates.
However, this means that when Peniko made semver-incompatible releases, crates which used this type could no longer (easily) interoperate.
To resolve this, `vello::peniko::FontData` (which is the same type but renamed) is now a re-export from a new crate called [Linebender Resource Handle](https://crates.io/crates/linebender_resource_handle).
These types have identical API as in previous releases, but will now be the same type across Peniko versions.

### Fixed

- Examples crashing when window is resized to zero. ([#1182][] by [@xStrom][])
- Correct flattening tolerance calculation from 2D affine transforms. ([#1187][] by [@tomcur][])
- Zero-width strokes were previously treated as fills. ([#785][] by [@DJMcNab][])
- Vello no longer writes to the console, instead outputting to `log`. ([#1017][] by [@DJMcNab][])

## [0.5.1][] - 2025-08-22

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.85.

### Changed

- Upgrade `skrifa` to `0.35.0` ([#1169][] by [@nicoburns][])

## [0.5.0][] - 2025-05-08

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.85.

### Added

- Breaking: Support for pipeline caches. ([#524][] by [@DJMcNab][])
- Implement `Default` for `RendererOptions`. ([#524][] by [@DJMcNab][])

```diff
 RendererOptions {
     // ...
+    ..Default::default()
 }
```

### Removed

- Breaking: `Renderer::render_to_surface` has been removed. ([#803][] by [@DJMcNab][])  
  This API was not fit for purpose, as it assumed that you would only ever use a single window.
  The new recommended way to use Vello to render to a surface is to use `Renderer::render_to_texture` to render to an
  intermediate texture, then blit from that to the surface yourself.
  We suggest using the [`TextureBlitter`](https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/util/struct.TextureBlitter.html) utility from `wgpu`.
  For users of the `util` module, it has been updated to create a suitable blit pipeline and intermediate texture for each surface.

```diff
+let target_view = /* cached: device.create_texture(/* size of surface*/).create_view(...) */;
- device.render_to_surface(..., &surface_texture, ...);
+ device.render_to_texture(..., &target_view, ...);
+let mut encoder = device.create_command_encoder(&wgpu::CommandEncoderDescriptor {
+    label: Some("Surface Blit"),
+});
+blitter.copy(
+    &device,
+    &mut encoder,
+    &target_view,
+    &surface_texture.create_view(&wgpu::TextureViewDescriptor::default()),
+);
+queue.submit([encoder.finish()]);
```

### Changed

- Breaking: wgpu has been updated to wgpu 24. ([#791][] by [@songhuaixu][])
  This has been chosen to match the version used by Bevy 0.16.
  (Note that we do not guarantee that our latest release will always match Bevy's wgpu version)
- Breaking: `override_image` has been updated to remove its use of `Arc`, as `wgpu::Texture`s are now internally reference counted. ([#802][] by [@DJMcNab][])

## [0.4.1][] - 2025-03-10

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Fixed

- Incorrect COLR Emoji Rendering ([#841][] by [@dfrg][])

## [0.4.0][] - 2025-01-20

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.82.

### Highlights

As part of an initiative to improve color handling across the ecosystem (and especially within Linebender crates), Vello is now using the new [`color`] crate.
This is the first step towards providing richer color functionality, better handling of color interpolation, and more.

This release intentionally uses `wgpu` 23.0.1 rather than 24.0.0 so that it can match the version used in Bevy 0.15.

### Changed

- Breaking: Updated `wgpu` to 23.0.1 ([#735][], [#743][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- Breaking: Updated to new `peniko` and `color` is now used for all colors ([#742][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- Breaking: As part of the update to `color`, the byte order of `vello_encoding::DrawColor` is changed ([#758][] by [@waywardmonkeys][], [#796][] by [@tomcur][]).
- Breaking: The `full` feature is no longer present as the full pipeline is now always built ([#754][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- The `r8` permutation of the shaders is no longer available ([#756][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- Breaking: The `buffer_labels` feature is no longer present as the labels are always configured ([#757][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- Breaking: Use a type alias for `i16` rather than `skrifa::NormalizedCoord` in the public API ([#747][] by [@nicoburns][])

### Fixed

- Offset in image rendering, and sampling outside correct atlas area ([#722][] by [@dfrg])
- Inference conflict when using Kurbo's `schemars` feature ([#733][] by [@ratmice][])
- Detection of PNG format bitmap fonts, primarily for Apple systems ([#740][] by [@LaurenzV])
- Support image extend modes, nearest-neighbor sampling and alpha ([#766][] by [@dfrg])
- Correct vertical offset for Apple Color Emoji ([#792][] by [@dfrg])

## [0.3.0][] - 2024-10-04

This release has an [MSRV][] of 1.75.

### Highlights

- Support for most Emoji ([#615][], [#641][] by [@DJMcNab])
- [GPU Friendly Stroke Expansion][stroke-expansion], which documents key parts of how Vello works, was released (by [@raphlinus], [@armansito])
- Blurred rounded rectangles are now supported, which can be used for box shadows ([#665][] by [@msiglreith][])
- Vello is no longer considered experimental ðŸŽ‰ ([#691][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
  Note that Vello is still an alpha, but we believe that the direction has been proven.

### Added

- Access to the `Adapter` from the utils `DeviceHandle` ([#634][] by [@cfagot][])
- Support for compositing existing `wgpu::Texture`s into a Vello scene ([#636][], [#655][] by [@DJMcNab], [@TrueDoctor][])
- Utilities for constructing an `AaSupport` from a set of `AaConfig`s ([#654][] by [@simbleau][])
- An example which uses sdl2 ([#671][] by [@TheNachoBIT][])
- The underlying `Encoding` for a scene can now be modified, circumventing guardrails for advanced use-cases ([#701][] by [@timtom-dev][])

### Changed

- Breaking: Updated `wgpu` to 22.1.0 ([#635][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- Clipping more than four layers deep is now supported ([#657][] by [@DJMcNab])
- Significantly improved automated testing ([#610][], [#643][] by [@DJMcNab])
- Preliminary debug layers for Vello's internal development ([#416][] by [@armansito])
- Examples now use the [`run_app`][] API from Winit ([#626][], [#628][] by [@yutannihilation][])
- Labels on GPU objects are now prefixed with `vello.` ([#677][] by [@waywardmonkeys])
- The async render implementations are deprecated and unstable; you should use the non-async versions as they enable greater throughput ([#706][] by [@DJMcNab])

### Fixed

- Example code in the repository README ([#627][] by [@kmoon2437][])
- A possible crash on iOS working around an invariant undocumented by Apple ([#639][] by [@DJMcNab][])
- Large number of clips now work ([#659][] by [@raphlinus])
- Empty clips now no longer cause artifacts ([#651][] by [@raphlinus])
- A potential panic in the presence of a weaker than default allocator ([#675][] by [@timtom-dev][])
- Watertightness breaks causing artifacts with some rounded rectangles ([#695][] by [@raphlinus])

### Removed

- Breaking: `Pipelines` API from `vello_shaders` ([#612][] by [@DJMcNab])
- The `wgpu_profiler` profiler feature is no longer stable ([#694][] by [@DJMcNab])
- Breaking: Moved the `Recording` abstraction into a `low_level` module, as almost all users should prefer the higher-level `Renderer` ([#711][] by [@DJMcNab])
