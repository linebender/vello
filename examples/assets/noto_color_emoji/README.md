# Noto Color Emoji Subset

This folder contains a small subset of [Noto Color Emoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji), licensed under the [OFL version 1.1](LICENSE).
We do not include the full set of Emoji, because including the entire Emoji set would increase the repository size too much.
Included emoji are:

- âœ… Check Mark - \u{2705}/`:white_check_mark:`
- ðŸ‘€ Eyes - \u{1f440}/`:eyes:`
- ðŸŽ‰ Party Popper - \u{1f389}/`:party_popper:`
- ðŸ¤  Face with Cowboy Hat - \u{1f920}/`cowboy_hat_face`

These are in the COLR format in `NotoColorEmoji-Subset` and in the CBTF format in `NotoColorEmoji-CBTF-Subset`.
This covers all ways that Emoji are commonly packaged, and both are supported by Vello.
